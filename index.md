### About Me

Hi. I'm a computer nerd who loves film. Or something like that. When I'm not [tweeting random stuff](https://twitter.com/kaborso), I'm either [programming](https://github.com/kaborso) or [studying](http://seneschalofdust.com/). Or I'm [watching](https://letterboxd.com/kaborso), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/kaborso), or [playing](http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaborso) something.

I am trying to get better at showing what I do rather than merely describing my interests. That said, I like studying film history and film theory. I am especially interested in queer cinema. I have some training in screenwriting, videography, and editing. With regard to programming, I like fiddling with bots, games, and computer graphics. However, my industry experience to this point lies in full-stack web development.

Contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaborso) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/664893/kaborso) for professional inquiries. You can also email me via **akil /dot/ brooks** on gmail.
